      <p>
        I am simply the best web developer in the entire world, not to brag, but I have pretty much developed every single website in existence (well, the good ones anyway). I have 25+ years of web development experience at the age of 18 and am getting better every single day! Not only am I able to write the HTML for a website, but also the CSS and the JavaScript, kind of. I'd like to see any other web developer try to do all of that! I also know how to organize all the website files and how to name them all properly! Did I mention compressing files? Because I can do that no problem as well! Honestly, I wish there was something I could not do perfectly because it's getting stale being perfect at everything. I would love to write more about how great I am, but unfortunately I have to get back to working on all of Google, Microsoft, and Amazon's websites at the same time!*

        <p>When I saw the final website, my jaw dropped. This website has not only words, but also some images on it. I have never seen anything like it before and it truly change my perspective on the world. This website has helped out our company so much as previously the only way people could contact us was by pigeon. This is truly a game-changer!</p>

        <p>I could not be happier with the website that Nate has created for our company! Not only can people view it, it also has content on it, simply amazing! I will 100% go back to Nate if I need another website made and I will also recommend him to everyone!</p>
